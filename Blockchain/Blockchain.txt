@@ HOW TO WRITE A SMART CONTRACT
Q) How to write a smart contract?
A)
``` javascript
Step 1: Understand the Requirements
Before writing code, clearly define what you want your smart contract to achieve. Identify the main functions, user interactions, and any rules it must follow.
Step 2: Setup Your Development Environment
To start coding, use tools like REMIX, Visual Studio Code with Solidity extensions, or JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA with Solidity plugins.
Step 3: Write Your First Contract
Begin a new Solidity file with a '.sol' extension, starting with the version pragma to specify the compiler version.
Step 4: Define State Variables and Functions
Inside your contract, define state variables for data storage and functions for operations.
Step 5: Compile Your Contract
Compile using your IDE or 'truffle compile' for syntax checks and generating ABI and bytecode.
Step 6: Test Your Contract
Write tests using Truffle to ensure your contract works correctly.
Step 7: Deploy Your Contract
Deploy to a test network like Ropsten using 'truffle migrate'.
Step 8: Interact with Your Contract
(Optional) Deploy to Mainnet and verify the source code on platforms like Etherscan.

@@ GRAMMATIC / COMPRESSED NFTS
Q) What are Grammatic or Compressed NFTs? 
A) Grammatic or Compressed NFTs are not a standard like ERC-721 but rather a concept or approach to creating NFTs in a more data-efficient manner. The idea revolves around compressing the data associated with NFTs or utilizing algorithms that can generate complex outputs from smaller sets of input data. This approach can include:
• Procedural Generation: Where the data for generating the NFT artwork or attributes is algorithmically produced based on a smaller set of seed data.
• Compression Techniques: Using advanced data compression algorithms to reduce the storage and bandwidth requirements for NFTs.
The goal is to reduce the cost of minting and transferring NFTs and to enable more complex and dynamic NFTs by minimizing the on-chain footprint.
ERC-721TL Tokenized License
Q) What is ERC-721TL? 
A) As of my last update in April 2023, ERC-721TL is not a widely recognized or standardized extension of the ERC-721 standard. It's possible that ERC-721TL could refer to a specialized or proposed extension focusing on tokenizing licenses using the ERC-721 framework. The "TL" could imply a "Tokenized License," suggesting a use case where the NFTs represent some form of licensing rights, such as digital media usage rights, software licenses, or other intellectual property rights in a non-fungible manner. However, without mainstream documentation or adoption, the specifics of ERC-721TL remain speculative.
ERC-721M
Q) What is ERC-721M? 
A) ERC-721M refers to an enhanced version or modification of the ERC-721 standard that aims to address specific issues or introduce new functionalities. Given the pace at which the NFT and broader blockchain technology landscape evolves, several proposals and implementations might go by similar names, aiming to optimize gas costs, introduce batch processing capabilities, or incorporate metadata and royalty standards more efficiently.
One notable effort in the direction of enhancing ERC-721 for better performance and flexibility is the ERC-721A, developed by Azuki. This implementation allows for gas-efficient batch minting of NFTs, significantly reducing the gas cost when minting multiple NFTs at once. While "ERC-721M" could conceptually align with such improvements, the specific details or proposals would depend on the context in which the term is used.
Q) Write Popular integrated development environment IDE for Smart Contract Development 
A) REMIX: Popular choices include Remix a web-based IDE, Visual Studio Code with Solidity extensions, or JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA with Solidity plugins.
Q) What is the purpose of the version pragma in Solidity?
