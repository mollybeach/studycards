# BLOCKCHAIN

# BASIC SOLIDITY

### Solidity:

  - Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, primarily Ethereum.

### Smart contract:

  - A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. It automatically enforces and executes the terms of a contract based on the programmed logic.

### Difference between 'view' and 'pure' functions In Solidity:

  - A 'view' function reads from the blockchain but does not modify it. A 'pure' function neither reads from nor writes to the blockchain.

### Gas and its relation to Solidity contracts:

  - Gas is the execution fee for operations on the Ethereum network. Optimizing contracts for lower gas consumption is crucial in Solidity development.



# INTERMEDIATE SOLIDITY

### Events in Solidity:

  - Events are used by contracts to communicate occurrences on the blockchain, triggering external actions and logging transaction details.

### Significance of the "payable" keyword in Solidity:

  - 'payable' allows functions to receive Ether. Without it, functions cannot accept Ether.

### How do modifiers work in Solidity:

  - Modifiers are code snippets that can modify function behavior, often for access control or validation.

### Differences between 'memory' and 'storage' variables in Solidity:

  - 'storage' variables persist on the blockchain, while 'memory' variables are temporary and erased between function calls.



# ADVANCED SOLIDITY

### Inheritance in Solidity contracts:

  - Solidity supports multiple inheritance, enabling contracts to inherit properties and functions for code reusability.

### Error handling in Solidity:

  - Solidity uses 'require', 'assert', and 'revert' for different types of error handling.

### ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards:

  - ERC-20 for fungible tokens, ERC-721 for non-fungible tokens on Ethereum.

### Delegate calls and associated risks:

  - 'delegatecall' allows contracts to execute code in another contract's context, posing security risks like reentrancy attacks.

### Concept of upgradable contracts in Solidity:

  - Upgradable contracts modify behavior without changing addresses, often using proxies for upgrades and bug fixes.



# DEFI

### Ethereum Virtual Machine EVM:

  - The EVM is Ethereum's runtime environment for executing smart contract bytecode.

### Transactions in Ethereum:

  - Transactions are signed messages that transfer ether, interact with contracts, or deploy new contracts.

### DeFi and its difference from traditional finance:

  - DeFi refers to decentralized financial services on blockchain, without centralized intermediaries.

### Concept of liquidity pools:

  - Liquidity pools are smart contracts that facilitate decentralized trading and earn fees.

### Yield farming and associated risks:

  - Yield farming maximizes crypto returns with risks like smart contract vulnerabilities and market volatility.

### Stablecoins and their stability maintenance:

  - Stablecoins maintain value through collateral or algorithmic mechanisms, crucial in reducing DeFi volatility.

### Difference between ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens:

  - ERC-20 for fungible tokens, ERC-721 for unique, non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

### Flash loans in DeFi:

  - Flash loans are uncollateralized loans repaid in a single transaction block, used for arbitrage and more.

### Automated market makers AMMs:

  - AMMs automate token trading using liquidity pools, determining prices via mathematical formulas.

### Impermanent loss definition:

  - Impermanent loss occurs in liquidity pools when token price ratios change after depositing.



# STAKING

### Staking in blockchain and cryptocurrencies:

  - Staking validates transactions on PoS blockchains by locking cryptocurrency as collateral for rewards.

### Difference between staking and mining:

  - Staking secures PoS networks by holding crypto, while mining validates PoW networks with computational puzzles.

### Benefits of staking for cryptocurrency holders:

  - Staking earns passive income, secures networks, and decentralizes power among participants.

### Risks of staking cryptocurrencies:

  - Risks include losing funds to network attacks, technical flaws, or penalties like slashing.

### Getting started with staking cryptocurrencies:

  - Start by choosing a PoS blockchain, acquiring crypto, and setting up staking via wallet or platform.

### Slashing in staking:

  - Slashing penalizes validators for malicious behavior or downtime on PoS networks.

### Delegation in staking cryptocurrencies:

  - Delegation lets holders stake without running a node, earning rewards via chosen validators.

### Active vs. passive staking:

  - Active staking runs nodes and engages in network consensus, while passive delegates to earn rewards.

### Staking's role in blockchain security and decentralization:

  - Staking secures networks by incentivizing honesty and distributing power among participants.

### Popular PoS blockchains supporting staking:

  - Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, Polkadot, Tezos, and Cosmos are popular PoS blockchains.



# Optimism

### Optimism and layer-2 scaling for Ethereum:

  - Optimism scales Ethereum with Optimistic Rollups, processing transactions off-chain for lower fees.

### Optimistic Rollups vs. ZK-Rollups:

  - Optimistic Rollups assume transaction validity by default, using fraud proofs if challenged; ZK-Rollups provide cryptographic proofs for instant finality.

### Security of transactions on Optimism:

  - Optimism leverages Ethereum's security with fraud proofs to verify transaction integrity.

### Implications of fraud proofs in Optimism:

  - Fraud proofs secure transactions but introduce withdrawal delays to verify against Ethereum.



## SMART-CONTRACTS

### Smart Contracts:

  - Self-executing contracts with terms written into code, enforcing agreements automatically.

### Abstract Contracts:

  - Contracts with unimplemented functions, used as base contracts for inheritance.

### Interface Contracts:

  - Contracts defining functions without implementations, ensuring contract compatibility.

### Library Contracts:

  - Reusable contracts for functions without state, enhancing code modularity.

### Immutable and Constant State Variables:

  - Variables set at compile or construction time, with 'immutable' allowing post-construction value changes.

### Proxy Contracts:

  - Contracts routing calls to logic contracts, enabling contract upgrades without changing addresses.

### Factory Contracts:

  - Contracts creating new instances of specific contracts dynamically.

### Payable Contracts:

  - Contracts and functions accepting Ether payments.

### Fallback and Receive Functions:

  - Special functions handling Ether transfers or unmatched function calls in contracts.

## HOW TO WRITE A SMART CONTRACT

### How to write a smart contract:

A)

```javascript
Step 1: Understand the Requirements
Before writing code, clearly define what you want your smart contract to achieve. Identify the main functions, user interactions, and any rules it must follow.
Step 2: Setup Your Development Environment
To start coding, use tools like REMIX, Visual Studio Code with Solidity extensions, or JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA with Solidity plugins.
Step 3: Write Your First Contract
Begin a new Solidity file with a '.sol' extension, starting with the version pragma to specify the compiler version.
Step 4: Define State Variables and Functions
Inside your contract, define state variables for data storage and functions for operations.
Step 5: Compile Your Contract
Compile using your IDE or 'truffle compile' for syntax checks and generating ABI and bytecode.
Step 6: Test Your Contract
Write tests using Truffle to ensure your contract works correctly.
Step 7: Deploy Your Contract
Deploy to a test network like Ropsten using 'truffle migrate'.
Step 8: Interact with Your Contract
(Optional) Deploy to Mainnet and verify the source code on platforms like Etherscan.
```



## GRAMMATIC / COMPRESSED NFTS

### What are Grammatic or Compressed NFTs:

  - Grammatic or Compressed NFTs are not a standard like ERC-721 but rather a concept or approach to creating NFTs in a more data-efficient manner. The idea revolves around compressing the data associated with NFTs or utilizing algorithms that can generate complex outputs from smaller sets of input data. This approach can include:

• Procedural Generation: Where the data for generating the NFT artwork or attributes is algorithmically produced based on a smaller set of seed data.

• Compression Techniques: Using advanced data compression algorithms to reduce the storage and bandwidth requirements for NFTs.

The goal is to reduce the cost of minting and transferring NFTs and to enable more complex and dynamic NFTs by minimizing the on-chain footprint.

ERC-721TL Tokenized License

### What is ERC-721TL:

  - As of my last update in April 2023, ERC-721TL is not a widely recognized or standardized extension of the ERC-721 standard. It's possible that ERC-721TL could refer to a specialized or proposed extension focusing on tokenizing licenses using the ERC-721 framework. The "TL" could imply a "Tokenized License," suggesting a use case where the NFTs represent some form of licensing rights, such as digital media usage rights, software licenses, or other intellectual property rights in a non-fungible manner. However, without mainstream documentation or adoption, the specifics of ERC-721TL remain speculative.

ERC-721M

### What is ERC-721M:

  - ERC-721M refers to an enhanced version or modification of the ERC-721 standard that aims to address specific issues or introduce new functionalities. Given the pace at which the NFT and broader blockchain technology landscape evolves, several proposals and implementations might go by similar names, aiming to optimize gas costs, introduce batch processing capabilities, or incorporate metadata and royalty standards more efficiently.

One notable effort in the direction of enhancing ERC-721 for better performance and flexibility is the ERC-721A, developed by Azuki. This implementation allows for gas-efficient batch minting of NFTs, significantly reducing the gas cost when minting multiple NFTs at once. While "ERC-721M" could conceptually align with such improvements, the specific details or proposals would depend on the context in which the term is used.

### Write Popular integrated development environment IDE for Smart Contract Development

  - REMIX: Popular choices include Remix a web-based IDE, Visual Studio Code with Solidity extensions, or JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA with Solidity plugins.

### What is the purpose of the version pragma in Solidity:

  - The version pragma specifies the version of the Solidity compiler to be used for compiling the smart contract code. It ensures that the code is compiled using the correct compiler version to avoid compatibility issues and ensure the correct interpretation of the code.
