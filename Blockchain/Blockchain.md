# BLOCKCHAIN

# BASIC SOLIDITY

### What is Solidity: A)

• Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, primarily Ethereum.

### What is a smart contract: A)

• A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. It automatically enforces and executes the terms of a contract based on the programmed logic.

### Can you explain the difference between a function marked as 'view' and one marked as 'pure" In Solidity: A)

• A 'view' function declares that no state will be changed, meaning it can read from the blockchain but not modify it. A 'pure" function declares that it will neither read from nor write to the blockchain.

### What is gas, and how does it relate to Solidity contracts: A)

• Gas refers to the execution fee that users pay to perform operations on the Ethereum network.

In Solidity, every operation has a gas cost, and optimizing contracts for lower gas consumption is a crucial aspect of development.

# INTERMEDIATE SOLIDITY

### What are events in Solidity, and how are they used: A)

• Events are a way for contracts to communicate that something has happened on the blockchain. They are used to trigger external actions and log transaction details, which can be listened to by external clients.

### Explain the significance of the "payable" keyword in Solidity. A)

• The 'payable' keyword allows a function to receive Ether. Without "payable", a function cannot be called with a value in terms of Ether.

### How do modifiers work in Solidity: A)

• Modifiers are code snippets that can be run before and/or after a function call. They are used to modify the behavior of a function, often for access control or validating conditions.

### What are the differences between 'memory" and "storage' variables in Solidity: A)

• 'storage' variables are stored permanently on the blockchain, while "memory" variables are temporary and erased between external function calls. The choice between them affects gas consumption and contract logic.

# ADVANCED SOLIDITY

### Discuss the concept of inheritance in Solidity contracts. A)

• Solidity supports multiple inheritance and allows contracts to inherit other contract properties and functions, enabling code reusability and organization.

### How can you handle errors in Solidity: A)

• Solidity uses 'require', 'assert', and 'revert' statements for error handling. "require" is used for input validation, 'assert" is used for checking invariants, and "revert" allows for custom error messages.

### Explain the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards. A)

• ERC-20 and ERC-721 are standards for implementing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

ERC-20 is for fungible tokens identical and divisible, while ERC-721 is for non-fungible tokens unique and indivisible.

### What are delegate calls, and what risks do they pose: A)

• 'delegatecall' Is a low-level function call that allows a contract to execute code in the context of another contract. it poses security risks, such as reentrancy attacks, because it can alter the state of the calling contract in unexpected ways.

### Can you explain the concept of upgradable contracts in Solidity: A)

• Upgradable contracts allow for the modification of a contract's behavior without changing its address. This is often achieved using proxies that delegate calls to implementation contracts, allowing for bug fixes and upgrades.

# DEFI*

### What is the Ethereum Virtual Machine EVM: A)

• The EVM is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It's a quasi-Turing complete machine that executes the bytecode of smart contracts.

### How do transactions work in Ethereum: A)

• Transactions are signed messages initiated by an externally owned account, submitted to the network to transfer ether, interact with a contract, or deploy a new contract. They include a nonce, gas limit, gas price, and optionally data for contract interactions.

### What is DeFi and how does it differ from traditional finance: A)

• DeFi, or decentralized finance, refers to financial services that operate on blockchain networks, allowing for permissionless, transparent, and secure transactions without centralized intermediaries. It differs from traditional finance in its accessibility, transparency, and reliance on smart contracts.

### Can you explain the concept of liquidity pools and how they function: A)

• Liquidity pools are collections of funds locked in a smart contract, used to facilitate decentralized trading, lending, and many other functions. They allow users to trade tokens, earn fees through providing liquidity, and enable automated market making AMM.

### What is yield farming, and what risks are associated with it: A)

• Yield farming involves seeking to maximize returns on crypto assets by participating in DeFi protocols that offer rewards for lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity. Risks include smart contract vulnerabilities, impermanent loss, and market volatility.

### How do stablecoins maintain their stability, and why are they important in DeFi: A)

• Stablecoins maintain their value through collateralization backed by other cryptocurrencies, fiat money, or commodities or algorithmic mechanisms that adjust supply. They are crucial for reducing volatility in DeFi transactions.

### Explain the difference between ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens. A)

• ERC-20 is a standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, where each token is identical. ERC-721 is a standard for non-fungible tokens NFTS, where each token is unique and can represent different assets.

### What is a flash loan, and how can it be used in DeFI: A)

• A flash loan is an uncollateralized loan option in DeFi that allows borrowers to take out a loan and repay it within the same transaction block. If the loan is not repaid in the block, the entire transaction is reversed. It can be used for arbitrage, collateral swaps, or self-liquidation.

### How do automated market makers AMMs work: A)

• AMMs allow digital assets to be traded in an automated and permissionless way by using liquidity pools rather than a traditional market of buyers and sellers. Prices are determined by a mathematical formula based on the pool's current balances.

### What is impermanent loss, and when does it occur: A)

• Impermanent loss occurs in liquidity pools when the price ratio of deposited tokens changes after depositing them into a pool. It's called "impermanent" because the loss is only realized if the liquidity is withdrawn at the unfavorable price ratio.

# STAKING*

### What is staking in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies: A)

• Staking refers to the process of participating in the validation of transactions on a proof-of-stake PoS blockchain by locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral. In return, stakers receive rewards for their contributions to the network.

### How does staking differ from mining in blockchain networks: A)

• Staking and mining are both mechanisms for securing blockchain networks, but they differ in their underlying consensus algorithms. Mining is used in proof-of-work PoW networks, where miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions. Staking is used in PoS networks, where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to lock up.

### What are the benefits of staking for cryptocurrency holders: A)

• Staking allows cryptocurrency holders to earn rewards by participating in the network's consensus mechanism. It provides a passive income stream, incentivizes network security, and promotes decentralization by distributing power among network participants.

### What are the risks associated with staking cryptocurrencies: A)

• Risks of staking include the potential loss of staked funds due to network attacks or technical vulnerabilities. There is also the risk of slashing, where a validator loses a portion of their stake for malicious behavior or downtime.

### How can users get started with staking cryptocurrencies: A)

• Users can get started with staking by choosing a PoS blockchain that supports staking, acquiring the required cryptocurrency, setting up a staking wallet or platform, and delegating or running a validator node to start earning rewards.

### What is slashing in the context of staking cryptocurrencies: A)

• Slashing is a penalty mechanism in PoS blockchains where validators lose a portion of their staked funds for malicious behavior or failing to fulfill their duties. Slashing is designed to deter validators from acting against the network's interests.

### How does delegation work in staking cryptocurrencies: A)

• Delegation allows cryptocurrency holders to participate in staking without running a validator node themselves. By delegating their stake to a validator, users can earn rewards based on the validator's performance while maintaining control of their funds.

### What is the difference between active and passive staking: A)

• Active staking involves running a validator node and actively participating in the network's consensus mechanism. Passive staking, on the other hand, involves delegating funds to a validator and earning rewards without actively managing the staking process.

### How does staking contribute to the security and decentralization of blockchain networks: A)

• Staking contributes to network security by incentivizing participants to act honestly and validate transactions accurately. It also promotes decentralization by distributing power among a larger number of network participants, reducing the risk of centralization.

### What are some popular PoS blockchains that support staking: A)

• Popular PoS blockchains that support staking include Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, Polkadot, Tezos, and Cosmos. Each of these blockchains has its staking mechanisms and requirements for participants.

### How does the concept of slashing prevent malicious behavior in staking: A)

• Slashing is a penalty mechanism that disincentivizes validators from engaging in malicious behavior by imposing financial penalties for actions that harm the network. Validators risk losing a portion of their staked funds if they act against the network's interests, such as double-signing blocks or going offline.

Security and Risks

### What are some common risks in DeFi, and how can they be mitigated: A)

• Common risks include smart contract vulnerabilities, protocol governance issues, and front-running attacks. Mitigation strategies include thorough code audits, insurance coverage, and user education on security practices.

### Can you discuss a major DeFi hack or exploit and the lessons learned from it: A)

• Candidates should be able to detail specific incidents, such as the DAO hack or the various flash loan attacks, discussing the vulnerabilities exploited and the impact on protocol design and security practices going forward.

Regulatory and Ethical Considerations

### How do regulatory bodies impact DeFi, and what challenges do they pose: A)

• Regulatory bodies impact DeFi by attempting to apply financial regulations to protect consumers and ensure market integrity. Challenges include defining legal frameworks that accommodate the decentralized and global nature of DeFi, without stifling innovation.

### Discuss the ethical considerations in DeFi development and usage. A)

• Ethical considerations include ensuring equitable access to financial services, protecting users from scams and excessive risks, and addressing environmental concerns related to blockchain.

# Optimism*

### What is Optimism, and how does it implement layer-2 scaling for Ethereum: A)

• Optimism is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that uses Optimistic Rollups. It allows for the execution of smart contracts and transactions off the main Ethereum chain, while still leveraging the Ethereum network for security. This approach significantly reduces gas fees and increases transaction throughput.

### Explain the concept of Optimistic Rollups and how they differ from ZK-Rollups. A)

• Optimistic Rollups assume transactions are valid by default and only run computations via fraud proofs in the event of a challenge. ZK-Rollups, on the other hand, provide cryptographic proofs for each transaction, verifying their validity upfront. Optimistic Rollups offer simpler compatibility with Ethereum contracts but have a challenge period for withdrawals, while ZK-Rollups provide instant finality but are more complex to develop.

### How does Optimism ensure the security of transactions and smart contracts executed on its platform: A)

• Optimism relies on the underlying security of the Ethereum mainnet. It uses a system of fraud proofs to ensure that any malicious activity can be challenged and corrected by verifying the disputed transaction's execution against the Ethereum mainnet.

### Discuss the implications of the "fraud proof" mechanism in Optimism for developers and users. A)

• For developers, understanding the fraud proof mechanism is crucial for designing applications that minimize the risk of disputes and optimize for the challenge window. For users, this mechanism ensures their transactions are secure but introduces a withdrawal delay when moving assets back to the Ethereum mainnet.

General Questions on Polygon and Optimism

### What are the primary considerations for a developer when choosing between Polygon and Optimism for a project: A)

• Developers should consider transaction speed, cost, security model, compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem, and the specific needs of their application. The choice between Polygon and Optimism will depend on these factors and the trade-offs the developer is willing to make.

### How do Polygon and Optimism fit into the broader Ethereum scalability landscape: A)

• Both are crucial components of Ethereum's scaling strategy, offering different approaches to reduce congestion and fees on the mainnet. By providing scalable, efficient alternatives, they enable a more diverse and robust ecosystem of applications.

Understanding these aspects of Polygon and Optimism will not only help in interviews but also provide a solid foundation for working with Ethereum's scaling solutions.

CONTRACTS

### What are Smart Contracts: A)

• Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. They automatically enforce and execute the terms of the contract based on the programmed logic.

### What are Abstract Contracts A)

• Abstract contracts are contracts that cannot be compiled into bytecode as is, and therefore cannot be deployed to the blockchain. They are partially implemented contracts with at least one function without its implementation. These are used as base contracts, which other contracts can inherit and implement the missing functionalities.

### What are Interface Contracts: A)

• An interface defines a contract skeleton that declares functions without implementing them, similar to interfaces in other programming languages. Interfaces can include events, but they cannot have any function implementations or state variables. Contracts that inherit from an interface must implement all its functions. Interfaces are a way to ensure certain functionality is present in a contract, serving as a contract between different contracts.

### What are Library Contracts: A)

• Libraries in Solidity are special contracts that are intended for reuse. A library is a collection of functions that are defined in a special type of contract, which does not have storage and cannot hold Ether. Functions in a library can be called directly if they do not modify the state. Otherwise, they are used in conjunction with the 'using for directive, allowing the library functions to be called on specific types.

### What are Immutable and Constant State Variables: A)

• While not contract types, immutable and constant are important qualifiers for state variables in contracts. Variables marked as "constant" are similar to constants in other programming languages; their values are set at compile time and cannot change. 'Immutable" variables are set once during contract creation and cannot be changed afterwards, unlike 'constant' variables, their values can be set during the construction time of the contract.

### What are Proxy Contracts: A)

• Proxy contracts are a design pattern used to enable contract upgradeability or efficient gas usage. A proxy contract delegates calls to a logic contract, which contains the actual code. This allows for the logic contract to be updated without changing the address of the contract users interact with.

### What are Factory Contracts: A)

• Factory contracts are a pattern for creating new contracts. A factory contract has a function that deploys a new instance of a specific contract and returns its address. This is useful for creating contracts whose parameters are not known at compile time and for managing collections of contracts.

### What are Payable Contracts: A)

• Payable is a keyword that can be applied to functions and constructors to allow them to receive Ether. Without specifying "payable', a function or contract cannot receive Ether through regular transactions.

### What are Fallback and Receive Functions: A)

• A contract can have at most one fallback function and one receive function. The 'receive' function is called when the contract receives Ether with no data, and is 'external' and payable. The 'fallback" function is called when none of the other functions match the called function signature, or if the contract received plain Ether with or without data and has no receive function. it is also 'external' and can be made payable'.

HOW TO WRITE A SMART CONTRACT

### How to write a smart contract: A)

Step 1: Understand the Requirements

Before writing code, clearly define what you want your smart contract to achieve. Identify the main functions, how users will interact with the contract, and any constraints or rules the contract must adhere to.

Step 2: Setup Your Development Environment

To start coding your smart contract, you'll need an integrated development environment IDE and a few tools:

• REMIX: Popular choices include Remix a web-based IDE, Visual Studio Code with Solidity extensions, or JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA with Solidity plugins.

• Node.js: Required for running Ethereum development tools.

• Truffle Suite: A development framework for Ethereum that makes it easy to compile, migrate, and test smart contracts.

• Ganache: Part of the Truffle Suite, Ganache is a personal blockchain for Ethereum development you can use to deploy contracts, develop applications, and run tests.

• MetaMask: A browser extension that allows you to interact with Ethereum blockchains and manage accounts and transactions.

Step 3: Write Your First Contract

Open your IDE and start a new Solidity file with a ' .sol' extension. Begin with the version pragma to specity the compiler version, then define your contract:

Step 4: Define State Variables and Functions

Inside your contract, define state variables to store data and functions to manipulate those variables or perform other operations:

Step 5: Compile Your Contract

Use your IDE or the command line to compile your contract. If you're using Truffle, you can run 'truffle compile' in your project directory. Compilation checks for syntax errors and generates the ABI and bytecode needed for deployment.

Step 6: Test Your Contract

Write tests to verify your contract's behavior. Testing can be done through Truffle using JavaScript or Solidity. Tests should cover all functions and possible edge cases.

Step 7: Deploy Your Contract

Deploy your contract to a test network like Ropsten, Rinkeby, or Ganache for local testing. You can use Truffle, Remix, or other deployment tools to deploy your contract. if using Truffle, you would write a migration script and run 'truffle migrate'.

Step 8: Interact with Your Contract

Step 9: Deploy to Mainnet Optional

Step 10: Verify and Publish Your Contract Source Code

After deployment, consider verifying and publishing your contract's source code on platforms like Etherscan. This step increases transparency and trust, allowing others to interact with your contract.

# GRAMMATIC / COMPRESSED NFTS*

### What are Grammatic or Compressed NFTs: A)

• Grammatic or Compressed NFTs are not a standard like ERC-721 but rather a concept or approach to creating NFTs in a more data-efficient manner. The idea revolves around compressing the data associated with NFTs or utilizing algorithms that can generate complex outputs from smaller sets of input data. This approach can include:

• Procedural Generation: Where the data for generating the NFT artwork or attributes is algorithmically produced based on a smaller set of seed data.

• Compression Techniques: Using advanced data compression algorithms to reduce the storage and bandwidth requirements for NFTs.

The goal is to reduce the cost of minting and transferring NFTs and to enable more complex and dynamic NFTs by minimizing the on-chain footprint.

ERC-721TL Tokenized License

### What is ERC-721TL: A)

• As of my last update in April 2023, ERC-721TL is not a widely recognized or standardized extension of the ERC-721 standard. It's possible that ERC-721TL could refer to a specialized or proposed extension focusing on tokenizing licenses using the ERC-721 framework. The "TL" could imply a "Tokenized License," suggesting a use case where the NFTs represent some form of licensing rights, such as digital media usage rights, software licenses, or other intellectual property rights in a non-fungible manner. However, without mainstream documentation or adoption, the specifics of ERC-721TL remain speculative.

ERC-721M

### What is ERC-721M: A)

• ERC-721M refers to an enhanced version or modification of the ERC-721 standard that aims to address specific issues or introduce new functionalities. Given the pace at which the NFT and broader blockchain technology landscape evolves, several proposals and implementations might go by similar names, aiming to optimize gas costs, introduce batch processing capabilities, or incorporate metadata and royalty standards more efficiently.

One notable effort in the direction of enhancing ERC-721 for better performance and flexibility is the ERC-721A, developed by Azuki. This implementation allows for gas-efficient batch minting of NFTs, significantly reducing the gas cost when minting multiple NFTs at once. While "ERC-721M" could conceptually align with such improvements, the specific details or proposals would depend on the context in which the term is used.

Blockchain Security

### What is blockchain, and how does it work: A)

• Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a growing list of records called blocks, which are securely linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Once a block is added to the chain, it is immutable and cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks.

### What is a consensus mechanism in blockchain: A)

• Consensus mechanism is the process used to achieve agreement on a single data value among distributed processes or systems. Common mechanisms include Proof of Work PoW and Proof of Stake PoS, which ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the validity of transactions and the order in which they are added to the blockchain.

### What is a 51% attack, and how does it affect blockchain security: A)

• A 51% attack is a potential attack on a blockchain network where a single entity or group gains control of more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate or stake, allowing them to disrupt the network by double spending coins, reversing transactions, and halting new transactions. This attack undermines the decentralized nature of the blockchain and compromises its security.

### What is a Sybil attack, and how does it impact blockchain security: A)

• A Sybil attack is an attack where a single adversary operates multiple nodes on a network to gain a disproportionate influence on the network. This attack can manipulate the consensus mechanism, disrupt the network's operation, and compromise the integrity of the blockchain.

### What is node security in blockchain, and why is it important: A)

• Node security refers to the measures taken to secure the individual nodes on a blockchain network, including protection against unauthorized access and ensuring reliable and secure communication between nodes. Node security is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the blockchain network, preventing attacks, and ensuring the proper functioning of the consensus mechanism.

# Smart Contracts*

### What is a smart contract, and how does it work: A)

• A smart contract is a protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties by automatically executing the terms of the contract based on the programmed logic.

### What is a reentrancy attack, and how does it exploit smart contracts: A)

• A reentrancy attack is a malicious attack where the attacker drains funds from a smart contract by recursively calling the payment function. This exploit takes advantage of the way smart contracts handle external calls, allowing the attacker to withdraw funds multiple times before the contract's state is updated.

### What are gas limit and gas price in Ethereum, and how do they impact smart contracts: A)

• Gas is a unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute operations like transactions or smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Gas limit refers to the maximum amount of gas a user is willing to spend on a transaction, while gas price is the amount of Ether the user is willing to pay per unit of gas. These parameters impact the cost and execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

### What is Solidity, and why is it important for smart contract development: A)

• Solidity is a high-level, statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine EVM. Solidity is essential for writing the logic of smart contracts, defining data structures, and interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

### What is a decentralized application DApp, and how does it utilize smart contracts: A)

• A decentralized application DApp is an application that runs on a decentralized network, avoiding a single point of failure and control. DApps utilize smart contracts for their business logic, enabling trustless and transparent interactions between users without the need for intermediaries.

### What is the Oracle problem in smart contracts, and how is it addressed: A)

• The Oracle problem refers to the challenge faced by smart contracts in accessing real-world data from off-chain sources. Oracles are third-party services that provide this data, introducing a point of trust into the otherwise trustless environment. The Oracle problem is addressed by using multiple oracles, data aggregation, and cryptographic techniques to ensure the accuracy and reliability of external data.

### What is timestamp dependence in smart contracts, and why is it a security risk: A)

• Timestamp dependence refers to the security risks arising from the dependency of smart contracts on the block timestamp, which can be manipulated by miners. Timestamp dependence can lead to vulnerabilities in smart contracts, allowing attackers to exploit time-based conditions and execute malicious actions.

### What are underflow and overflow bugs in smart contracts, and how can they be prevented: A)

• Underflow and overflow bugs occur when arithmetic operations reach the maximum or minimum limits of what the data type can hold, leading to unexpected behaviors in smart contracts. These bugs can be prevented by using safe arithmetic libraries, checking for boundary conditions, and ensuring proper data validation in smart contract code.

Best Practices in Blockchain and Smart Contract Security

# Smart Contract Security

• Polkadot: Facilitates a network of blockchains that can operate independently but securely share information and transactions, offering a scalable and secure solution to the challenges of the Blockchain Trilemma.

# Formal Verification

### What is formal verification, and how does it ensure the correctness of smart contracts: A)

• Formal verification is a mathematical approach to prove or disprove the correctness of algorithms or systems under specified conditions. Formal verification ensures that the smart contract will behave correctly as per the formal specification under all conditions, providing a rigorous method to verify the security and reliability of smart contracts.

### What are the use cases of formal verification in smart contract development: A)

• Ensures that the contract will behave correctly as per the formal specification under all conditions, providing a rigorous method to verify the security and reliability of smart contracts.

Security Patterns and Best Practices

### What are security patterns in smart contract development, and how do they help prevent vulnerabilities: A)

• Security patterns are design patterns and best practices that help prevent vulnerabilities and exploits in smart contracts. Examples include using the checks-effects-interactions pattern, avoiding common pitfalls like reentrancy attacks, ensuring proper exception handling, and optimizing gas usage to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure the security of smart contracts.

### What are the best practices for securing smart contracts against vulnerabilities and exploits: A)

• Code Audits and Reviews: Regular and thorough reviews and audits of the smart contract code by independent third parties to identify vulnerabilities before deployment.

• Multi-signature Wallets: Use of wallets that require multiple keys to authorize a transaction, providing an additional layer of security for asset management.

• Testnets: Testing smart contracts extensively on test networks before deployment on the main network to ensure that there are no bugs or vulnerabilities.

• Bug Bounties: Programs offered by many blockchain projects to reward individuals who find and report bugs, particularly those related to exploits and vulnerabilities.

# Fuzz Testing

### What is fuzz testing, and how does it help identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts: A)

• Fuzz testing is a testing technique that involves feeding pseudo-randomly generated inputs to the smart contract to identify vulnerabilities and security risks. Fuzz testing helps identify edge cases, unexpected behaviors, and potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts, ensuring their security and reliability.

### What are the benefits of fuzz testing in smart contract security: A)

• Fuzz testing can catch issues that static analysis may miss, providing an additional layer of security and ensuring the robustness of the smart contract code.

### How does fuzz testing complement other testing techniques like static analysis and dynamic analysis: A)

• Fuzz testing complements static analysis by identifying vulnerabilities that may not be detected through code analysis alone. It also complements dynamic analysis by providing additional test cases and edge cases to ensure the security and reliability of smart contracts.

### What are the best practices for implementing fuzz testing in smart contract development: A)

• Use fuzz testing tools and frameworks to generate pseudo-random inputs and test the smart contract code for vulnerabilities.

• Test the smart contract under extreme conditions, high load, and edge cases to identify potential vulnerabilities and security risks.
