Q) What is the difference between `defer` and `panic` in Go?
A) The `defer` keyword in Go is used to schedule a function call to be executed when the surrounding function returns, while `panic` is used to trigger a runtime error and stop the program execution. `defer` is commonly used for cleanup tasks, while `panic` is used for exceptional situations.
Q) What is the difference between `make` and `new` in Go?
A) The `make` function in Go is used to create slices, maps, and channels with initial values and capacity, while the `new` function is used to allocate memory for a new value and return a pointer to it. `make` is used for built-in data structures, while `new` is used for custom data types.
Q) What is the difference between `nil` and `null` in Go?
A) In Go, `nil` is a zero value that represents the absence of a value for pointers, slices, maps, channels, and functions, while `null` is not a keyword in Go. `nil` is used to indicate the absence of a value or uninitialized memory.
Q) What is the difference between `range` and `for` in Go?
A) The `range` keyword in Go is used to iterate over elements in arrays, slices, maps, and channels, while the `for` keyword is used for general-purpose looping. `range` simplifies iteration over collections and provides access to both the index and value of each element.
Q) What is the difference between `sync.Mutex` and `sync.RWMutex` in Go?
A) `sync.Mutex` in Go is a mutual exclusion lock that allows only one goroutine to access a critical section at a time, while `sync.RWMutex` is a reader-writer lock that allows multiple readers or a single writer to access a critical section. `sync.RWMutex` is more efficient for read-heavy workloads.
