# CLOUD



### The Cloud

  - The cloud refers to a network of remote servers hosted on the internet that store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

### Benefits of using the cloud

  - Scalability, cost-effectiveness, flexibility, reliability, security, and accessibility.

### Major cloud service providers

  - Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).



## AWS AMAZON WEB SERVICES



### Core AWS Services

  - CloudFront, EC2 Elastic Compute Cloud, IAM Identity and Access Management, Lambda, RDS Relational Database Service, S3 Simple Storage Service, and VPC Virtual Private Cloud.

### EC2 Elastic Compute Cloud

  - A web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, designed to simplify web-scale computing.

### S3 Simple Storage Service

  - An object storage service offering scalability, data availability, security, and performance for storing and retrieving data.

### RDS Relational Database Service

  - A managed relational database service supporting various databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.

### VPC Virtual Private Cloud

  - A service for launching AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network with complete control over networking.

### IAM Identity and Access Management

  - A web service for securely controlling access to AWS services and resources.

### Lambda

  - A compute service for running code without provisioning or managing servers, scaling automatically based on demand.

### CloudFront

  - A content delivery network CDN service delivering data, videos, applications, and APIs globally with low latency and high speeds.

### Elasticity

  - The ability to easily scale computing resources up or down, adjusting capacity as computing needs change.

### High Availability

  - The ability to maintain operational services during faults or increasing loads by adding resources.

### Fault Tolerance

  - The capability to continue operating despite component failures.

# ) Region vs. Availability Zone

  - A Region is a geographical area with multiple Availability Zones, isolated locations within data centers ensuring redundancy and low latency.

### Security Group

  - Acts as a virtual firewall controlling inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances.

### Key Pair

  - Used in EC2 for secure instance access.

### Route 53

  - A scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service.

### CloudWatch

  - A monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and applications.

### CloudTrail

  - A service for governance, compliance, and operational auditing of AWS accounts.

### Elastic Beanstalk

  - A service for deploying and scaling web applications and services without managing servers.

### CloudFormation

  - A service for orderly creation and management of AWS and third-party resources.

### Reserved Instances

  - Provides significant cost savings compared to On-Demand instance pricing with capacity reservation.

### Spot Instances

  - Allows bidding on unused EC2 capacity, running instances as long as the bid exceeds the current spot price.



## AZURE



### Core Azure Services

  - App Service, Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, Functions, Resource Manager, SQL Database, and Virtual Machines.

### App Service

  - A managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps and APIs.

### Blob Storage

  - A service for storing large amounts of unstructured object data.

### Cosmos DB

### Resource Manager

  - Enables managing resources in solutions as a group.

### SQL Database

  - A managed relational database service offering high availability, security, and scalability.

### Virtual Machines

  - Service for creating and managing virtual machines in the cloud.

### Azure Active Directory

  - A cloud-based service for identity and access management.

### Azure DevOps

  - Services for building, testing, and deploying applications across platforms.

### Azure Kubernetes Service

  - Managed Kubernetes service simplifying containerized application deployment.

### Azure Monitor

  - Provides full-stack monitoring (metrics, logs, and traces) for applications and infrastructure.

### Azure Storage

  - Scalable, secure, and highly available storage service.

### Azure Virtual Network

  - Service for creating isolated networks with control over IP addresses, DNS settings, security policies, and routing.

### Azure Web Apps

  - Managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps and APIs.

### Azure Cognitive Services

  - APIs offering AI capabilities (vision, language, speech, decision-making) for integrating AI into applications.

### Setting up Azure AI Services with TypeScript

  - Install Node.js and npm, then TypeScript globally. Install Azure SDKs via npm for services needed, using them to interact with Azure AI Services.

### Integrating Azure SDKs with TypeScript for Azure AI Services

  - Install Azure SDKs via npm, import and use them in TypeScript code.

### Authentication and authorization with Azure AI Services

  - Use Azure Active Directory, generate API keys for authentication, secure communication with HTTPS.
