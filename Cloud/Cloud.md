# CLOUD

### The Cloud

The cloud refers to a network of remote servers hosted on the internet that store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

### What are the benefits of using the cloud:

Scalability, cost-effectiveness, flexibility, reliability, security, and accessibility.

### Name three major cloud service providers.

Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).



## AWS AMAZON WEB SERVICES

### RDS Relational Database Service A) A managed relational database service that supports MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server, as well as Amazon Aurora, a high-performance managed relational database.

### VPC Virtual Private Cloud A)  A service that lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment.

###  IAM Identity and Access Management A) A web service that helps you securely control access to

AWS services and resources for your users.

### Lambda A)  A compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.

Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically.

### CloudFront A) A content delivery network CDN service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APis to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.

### Elasticity A) The ability to scale computing resources up or down easily, automatically adjusting capacity as computing requirements change.

### High Availability  A) The ability to keep services operational during various fault conditions and ensuring minimal service disruption or downtime. The ability to handle increasing loads by adding resources either horizontally adding more machines or vertically adding more power to existing machines.

### Fault Tolerance  A) The capability to continue operating even if some components of the system fail.

# ) Region vs. Availability Zone  A) A Region is a geographical area that consists of two or more Availability Zones, which are isolated locations within data center regions to provide redundancy and reduce latency.

###  Security Group  A) Acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.

### Key Pair  A) Used in EC2 to securely connect to your instances.

### Route 53  A) A scalable and highly available Domain Name System DNS web service.

### CloudWatch  A) A monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS.

### CloudTrail  A) A service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account.

### Elastic Beanstalk  A) An easyuse service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

### CloudFormation  A) A service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related AWS and third A)party resources, provision and manage them in an orderly and predictable fashion.

### Reserved Instances  A) Provide you with a significant discount compared to On-Demand instance pricing and provide a capacity reservation when used in a specific Availability Zone.

### Spot Instances  A) Allow you to bid on unused EC2 capacity and run those instances for as long as your bid exceeds the current spot price.



## AZURE

### Name 7 Core Azure Services A)

App Service, Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, Functions, Resource Manager, SQL Database, and Virtual Machines.

### App Service A) A fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps and APIs.

### Blob Storage A) A service for storing large amounts of unstructured object data, such as text or binary data.

### Cosmos DB A) A globally distributed, multi-model database service for building highly responsive and scalable applications.

### Functions A) A serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to manage infrastructure.

### Resource Manager A) A service that enables you to work with the resources in your solution as a group.

### SQL Database A) A managed relational database service that provides high availability, security, and scalability.

### Virtual Machines A) A service that lets you create and manage virtual machines in the cloud.

### Azure Active Directory A) A cloud-based identity and access management service that helps you secure your applications and resources.

### Azure DevOps A) A set of services for building, testing, and deploying applications to any platform.

### Azure Functions A) A serverless compute service that lets you run event-triggered code without having to manage infrastructure.

### Azure Kubernetes Service A) A managed Kubernetes service that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes.

### Azure Monitor A) A service that provides full-stack monitoring, including metrics, logs, and traces, for your applications and infrastructure.

### Azure Storage A) A service that provides scalable, secure, and highly available storage for your data.

### Azure Virtual Network A) A service that lets you create isolated networks in the cloud, with control over IP addresses, DNS settings, security policies, and routing.

### Azure Web Apps A) A fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps and APIs.

### What are Azure Cognitive Services, and how do they provide AI capabilities:

Offer APIs for AI capabilities like vision, language, speech, and decision-making. Key services include Computer Vision, Text Analytics, Speech to Text, and Language Understanding (LUIS). These services enable developers to integrate AI capabilities into their applications without needing to build the underlying AI models.

### How do you set up your development environment for integrating Azure AI Services with TypeScript:

• Install Node.js and npm: TypeScript runs on Node.js, so install them from the official Node.js website.

• Install TypeScript: Install TypeScript globally via npm.

### How do you integrate Azure SDKs with TypeScript for using Azure AI Services: A)

• Install Azure SDKs: For the Azure services you're using, install the respective Azure SDKs via npm. For example, to use the Text Analytics service, you would install the Azure AI Text Analytics SDK.

• Import and use the SDKs: In your TypeScript code, import the necessary SDKs and use them to interact with Azure AI Services.Q) How do you handle authentication and authorization when using Azure AI Services in your applications: A)

• Use Azure Active Directory: Azure AI Services support Azure Active Directory for authentication and authorization. You can configure access control policies and permissions in Azure AD to control who can access the AI services.

• Generate API keys: Some Azure AI Services require API keys for authentication. You can generate API keys in the Azure portal and use them in your applications to authenticate requests to the services.

• Secure communication: Ensure that communication between your applications and Azure AI Services is encrypted using HTTPS to protect sensitive data.
