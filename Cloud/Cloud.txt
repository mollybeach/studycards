Q) What are Azure Cognitive Services, and how do they provide AI capabilities? 
A) Offer APIs for AI capabilities like vision, language, speech, and decision-making. Key services include Computer Vision, Text Analytics, Speech to Text, and Language Understanding (LUIS). These services enable developers to integrate AI capabilities into their applications without needing to build the underlying AI models.
Q) How do you set up your development environment for integrating Azure AI Services with TypeScript?
A) • Install Node.js and npm: TypeScript runs on Node.js, so install them from the official Node.js website.
• Install TypeScript: Install TypeScript globally via npm.
Q) How do you integrate Azure SDKs with TypeScript for using Azure AI Services? A)
• Install Azure SDKs: For the Azure services you're using, install the respective Azure SDKs via npm. For example, to use the Text Analytics service, you would install the Azure AI Text Analytics SDK.
• Import and use the SDKs: In your TypeScript code, import the necessary SDKs and use them to interact with Azure AI Services.Q) How do you handle authentication and authorization when using Azure AI Services in your applications? A)
• Use Azure Active Directory: Azure AI Services support Azure Active Directory for authentication and authorization. You can configure access control policies and permissions in Azure AD to control who can access the AI services.
• Generate API keys: Some Azure AI Services require API keys for authentication. You can generate API keys in the Azure portal and use them in your applications to authenticate requests to the services.
• Secure communication: Ensure that communication between your applications and Azure AI Services is encrypted using HTTPS to protect sensitive data.
