GraphQL
Q) What is GraphQL? A) GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. It provides a flexible and efficient alternative to traditional REST APIs by enabling clients to specify the structure of the response and reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data.
Q) What are the key features of GraphQL? A) The key features of GraphQL include:
• Strongly Typed Schema: GraphQL uses a schema to define the types and fields available in the API, enabling clients to query and mutate data with type safety.
• Hierarchical Queries: GraphQL allows clients to request nested data structures in a single query, reducing the number of round trips to the server.
• Client-Defined Responses: GraphQL enables clients to specify the structure of the response, allowing them to request only the data they need.
• Real-Time Updates: GraphQL supports subscriptions for real-time data updates, enabling clients to receive updates as soon as the data changes.
• Tooling: GraphQL provides a rich ecosystem of tools, such as GraphQL Playground and Apollo Client, for developing, testing, and consuming GraphQL APIs.
Q) How does GraphQL work? A) GraphQL works by defining a schema that describes the types and fields available in the API. Clients can send queries to the server using the GraphQL query language to request specific data. The server processes the query, resolves the requested data, and returns a response in the shape defined by the query.
Q) What is a schema in GraphQL? A) A schema in GraphQL is a collection of types and fields that define the structure of the API. The schema specifies the available queries, mutations, and subscriptions, as well as the types of data that can be queried and mutated. The schema serves as a contract between the client and the server.
Q) What is a type in GraphQL? A) A type in GraphQL is a category of data that defines the shape of the data and the fields that can be queried or mutated. Types can be scalar types, such as String or Int, or complex types, such as Object or Enum. Types can have fields that represent attributes of the data.
Q) What is a query in GraphQL? A) A query in GraphQL is a request for specific data from the API. Queries are written in the GraphQL query language and specify the fields and relationships to be included in the response. Queries can be nested to request data from related types in a single request.
Q) What is a mutation in GraphQL? A) A mutation in GraphQL is a request to modify data in the API. Mutations are written in the GraphQL query language and specify the fields and data to be updated, created, or deleted. Mutations can be used to perform actions that change the state of the data in the API.
Q) What is a subscription in GraphQL? A) A subscription in GraphQL is a request to receive real-time updates from the API. Subscriptions are written in the GraphQL query language and specify the fields and data to be monitored for changes. Subscriptions enable clients to receive updates as soon as the data changes.
Q) What is a resolver in GraphQL? A) A resolver in GraphQL is a function that resolves the requested data for a field in the schema. Resolvers are responsible for fetching the data from the data source, transforming the data into the requested shape, and returning the data to the client. Resolvers are defined for each field in the schema.
Q) What is the difference between GraphQL and REST? A) GraphQL and REST are both API design paradigms, but they have some key differences:
• Data Fetching: GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, while REST APIs return fixed data structures.
• Endpoints: GraphQL has a single endpoint for all queries, mutations, and subscriptions, while REST APIs have multiple endpoints for different resources.
• Over-fetching and Under-fetching: GraphQL reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data by enabling clients to specify the structure of the response, while REST APIs may return more or less data than needed.
• Versioning: GraphQL does not require versioning of APIs, as clients can request specific data structures, while REST APIs may require versioning to maintain backward compatibility.
• Tooling: GraphQL provides a rich ecosystem of tools, such as GraphQL Playground and Apollo Client, for developing, testing, and consuming APIs, while REST APIs may require additional tooling for documentation and testing.
Q) How do you use/launch a GraphQL API? A) To use/launch a GraphQL API, follow these steps:
• Define a schema that describes the types and fields available in the API.
• Implement resolvers for each field in the schema to fetch and return the requested data.
• Set up a GraphQL server that processes queries, mutations, and subscriptions and resolves the requested data.
• Test the API using a GraphQL client, such as GraphQL Playground or Apollo Client, to send queries and mutations and receive responses.
• Deploy the GraphQL API to a server or cloud platform to make it accessible to clients.

REST
Q) What is REST? A) REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications that use HTTP to communicate between clients and servers. RESTful APIs are designed around resources, which are represented as URIs, and use standard HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations.
Q) What are the key principles of REST? A) The key principles of REST include:
• Resources: RESTful APIs are designed around resources, which are represented as URIs and can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods.
• Uniform Interface: RESTful APIs use a uniform interface, such as HTTP methods and status codes, to interact with resources.
• Statelessness: RESTful APIs are stateless, meaning that each request from the client contains all the information needed to process the request.
• Client-Server Architecture: RESTful APIs use a client-server architecture, where the client and server are separate and communicate through requests and responses.
• Layered System: RESTful APIs are designed as a layered system, where clients interact with intermediaries, such as proxies or gateways, to access resources.
Q) What are the key components of a RESTful API? A) The key components of a RESTful API include:
• Resources: Entities that can be accessed and manipulated through the API, represented as URIs.
• URIs: Uniform Resource Identifiers that uniquely identify resources in the API.
• HTTP Methods: Standard HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE, used to perform CRUD operations on resources.
• Headers: Additional information sent with the request or response, such as content type, authentication, or caching directives.
• Status Codes: Standard HTTP status codes, such as 200 OK, 404 Not Found, and 500 Internal Server Error, used to indicate the outcome of the request.
Q) What is a resource in a RESTful API? A) A resource in a RESTful API is an entity that can be accessed and manipulated through the API. Resources are represented as URIs and can have multiple representations, such as JSON or XML, that can be requested by clients. Resources can be created, read, updated, and deleted using standard HTTP methods.
Q) What is a URI in a RESTful API? A) A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) in a RESTful API is a string that uniquely identifies a resource. URIs are used to locate and access resources in the API and follow a hierarchical structure that represents the relationships between resources. URIs are composed of a scheme, host, path, and optional query parameters.
Q) What are the standard HTTP methods used in a RESTful API? A) The standard HTTP methods used in a RESTful API include:
• GET: Retrieve a representation of a resource.
• POST: Create a new resource.
• PUT: Update an existing resource with a complete representation.
• PATCH: Update an existing resource with a partial representation.
• DELETE: Remove a resource.
Q) What are HTTP headers in a RESTful API? A) HTTP headers in a RESTful API are additional information sent with the request or response. Headers can include metadata, such as content type, authentication credentials, caching directives, and custom headers. Headers provide context and control over the communication between clients and servers.
Q) What are HTTP status codes in a RESTful API? A) HTTP status codes in a RESTful API are standard codes that indicate the outcome of a request. Status codes are divided into five categories, such as 1xx informational, 2xx success, 3xx redirection, 4xx client error, and 5xx server error. Common status codes include 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found, and 500 Internal Server Error.
