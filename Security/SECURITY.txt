​*​Oauth 2.0*
Q) What is OAuth 2.0, and why is it important? A)
iis an authorization framework that allows third-party services to exchange web resources on behalf of a user. It's important because it enables users to grant web and desktop applications access to their information on other web services without revealing their passwords.
Q) Can you explain the difference between authentication and authorization in the context of OAuth 2.0? A)
• Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. Auth 2.0 is strictly an authorization protocol and does not handle authentication. It relies on the service hosting the user account to handle authentication.
Q) What are the four roles defined in OAuth 2.0? A) 
The four roles are:
• Resource Owner: Typically the user who authorizes an application to access their account.
• Client: The application that wants to access the user's account. The client must be authorized by the user.
• Authorization Server: The server that authenticates the Resource Owner and issues access tokens to the Client after getting proper authorization.
• Resource Server: The server hosting the protected resources. It can accept or respond to protected resource requests using access tokens.
Q) What are the grant types supported by OAuth 2.0?  A)  
 OAuth 2.0 defines four grant types:
• Authorization Code: Used by web and mobile apps where the client doesn't interact with the user directly.
• Implicit: Designed for clients implemented in a browser using a scripting language such as JavaScript.
• Resource Owner Password Credentials: Used when there is a high degree of trust between the resource owner and the client, such as the device's operating system or a highly privileged application.
• Client Credentials: Used when the client is acting on its own behalf, not on behalf of a user, and can authenticate itself.
Q) What is an access token, and how is it used in OAuth 2.0?  A)
• An access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the client. It is used by the client to access the resources on the Resource Server on behalf of the Resource Owner. The access token provides a secure way to ensure that the user data can be accessed without sharing user credentials directly with the client.
Q) Explain the concept of scopes in Auth 2.0. A)
• Scopes are a mechanism in Auth 2.0 to limit an application's access to a user's account.
They are used at the time of the request for authorization and define the level of access that the application is requesting to the user's data. Scopes enable the user to grant specific permissions to an application without exposing all user data.
Q) How does the Authorization Code grant type work? A)
• The Authorization Code grant type involves redirecting the user to the Authorization Server to log in. After successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the application with an authorization code that the application can exchange for an access token. This method is considered secure as the application never handles the user's credentials directly, and the access token is transmitted directly to * application server without passing through the user's browser.
