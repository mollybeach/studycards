• Attribute-based access control ABAC: Users are granted access based on attributes like user roles, location, or time of day.

• Access control lists (ACLs): Users are granted access to specific resources based on predefined lists of permissions.

### What is role-based access control RBAC :

  - Role-based access control RBAC is an authorization mechanism where users are assigned roles or permissions that determine their access to resources. Users are assigned roles like admin, user, or guest, and permissions like read, write, or delete, based on their responsibilities and access requirements. RBAC simplifies access control management by grouping users into roles and assigning permissions to roles rather than individual users.

### What is attribute-based access control ABAC:

  - Attribute-based access control ABAC is an authorization mechanism where users are granted access based on attributes like user roles, location, or time of day. ABAC policies define access rules based on user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental attributes to enforce fine-grained access controls. ABAC allows for dynamic and context-aware access decisions based on the attributes of the user, resource, and environment.

### What are access control lists ACLs:

  - Access control lists ACLs are authorization mechanisms where users are granted access to specific resources based on predefined lists of permissions. ACLs define access rules for users or groups of users to access resources like files, directories, or network resources. ACLs can be configured at the object level to control who can read, write, or execute specific resources.

### How can you implement secure authorization in web applications:

  - Secure authorization in web applications can be implemented by:

• Using role-based access control RBAC: Assign users roles or permissions that determine their access to resources based on their responsibilities and access requirements.

​*​Oauth 2.0*

### What is OAuth 2.0, and why is it important: A)

iis an authorization framework that allows third-party services to exchange web resources on behalf of a user. It's important because it enables users to grant web and desktop applications access to their information on other web services without revealing their passwords.

### Can you explain the difference between authentication and authorization in the context of OAuth 2.0: A)

• Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. Auth 2.0 is strictly an authorization protocol and does not handle authentication. It relies on the service hosting the user account to handle authentication.

### What are the four roles defined in OAuth 2.0: A)

The four roles are:

• Resource Owner: Typically the user who authorizes an application to access their account.

• Client: The application that wants to access the user's account. The client must be authorized by the user.

• Authorization Server: The server that authenticates the Resource Owner and issues access tokens to the Client after getting proper authorization.

• Resource Server: The server hosting the protected resources. It can accept or respond to protected resource requests using access tokens.

### What are the grant types supported by OAuth 2.0:  A)

OAuth 2.0 defines four grant types:

• Authorization Code: Used by web and mobile apps where the client doesn't interact with the user directly.

• Implicit: Designed for clients implemented in a browser using a scripting language such as JavaScript.

• Resource Owner Password Credentials: Used when there is a high degree of trust between the resource owner and the client, such as the device's operating system or a highly privileged application.

• Client Credentials: Used when the client is acting on its own behalf, not on behalf of a user, and can authenticate itself.

### What is an access token, and how is it used in OAuth 2.0:  A)

• An access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the client. It is used by the client to access the resources on the Resource Server on behalf of the Resource Owner. The access token provides a secure way to ensure that the user data can be accessed without sharing user credentials directly with the client.

### Explain the concept of scopes in Auth 2.0. A)

• Scopes are a mechanism in Auth 2.0 to limit an application's access to a user's account.

They are used at the time of the request for authorization and define the level of access that the application is requesting to the user's data. Scopes enable the user to grant specific permissions to an application without exposing all user data.

### How does the Authorization Code grant type work: A)

• The Authorization Code grant type involves redirecting the user to the Authorization Server to log in. After successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the application with an authorization code that the application can exchange for an access token. This method is considered secure as the application never handles the user's credentials directly, and the access token is transmitted directly to * application server without passing through the user's browser.



*REACT SECURITY*

### What is Cross-Site Scripting XSS, and how can it be prevented in React applications: A)

• Cross-Site Scripting XSS is a security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. In React applications, XSS can be prevented by:

• Using libraries like DOMPurity to sanitize content derived from user input.

• Escaping user input to prevent execution as code.

• Avoiding methods like "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" that can bypass React's automatic escaping.

### What is Cross-Site Request Forgery CSRF, and how can it be prevented in React applications: A)

• Cross-Site Request Forgery CSRF is an attack where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. In React applications, CSRF can be prevented by:

• Using CSRF tokens that are verified server-side with each state-changing request.

• Configuring cookies with the 'SameSite' attribute to restrict cross-site sharing.

### What are common security modules and middleware used in React applications: A)

• Helmet: A middleware that helps secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.

• CORS: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing with various options.

• Rate-limit: Middleware to prevent brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests a client can make in a given period.

### What are the best practices for securing React applications against vulnerabilities and exploits: A)

• Input Validation: Ensure all input is validated against a strict schema to prevent injection attacks.

• Error Handling: Avoid revealing sensitive application details in production error messages.

• Dependency Management: Regularly check for outdated and vulnerable packages using tools like npm audit or Yarn.
