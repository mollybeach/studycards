• Detects and responds to security incidents early to prevent data breaches and outages

• Fosters a culture of security awareness and responsibility among team members

### What are some common security practices in DevOps:

Common security practices in DevOps include:

• Secure coding: Follow secure coding practices and guidelines to prevent vulnerabilities

• Vulnerability scanning: Scan systems and applications for security vulnerabilities and weaknesses

• Penetration testing: Conduct penetration tests to identify and exploit security weaknesses

• Security monitoring: Monitor systems and applications for security incidents and anomalies

• Incident response: Develop and implement incident response plans to respond to security incidents

## Version Control

### What is version control in DevOps:

Version control in DevOps refers to the practice of tracking changes to code, documents, and other files using version control systems. It enables teams to collaborate, track changes, and manage code repositories effectively. Version control helps teams maintain code quality, track changes, and collaborate on software development projects.

### Why is version control important in DevOps:

Version control is important in DevOps because it:

• Tracks changes to code, documents, and files to maintain a history of revisions

• Enables collaboration and concurrent development by multiple team members

• Facilitates code reviews, branching, and merging to manage code changes

• Supports automation, continuous integration, and deployment pipelines

• Ensures code quality, consistency, and reliability in software development

### What are some common version control systems used in DevOps:

Common version control systems used in DevOps include:

• Git: Distributed version control system for tracking changes to code and files

• GitHub: Web-based platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on projects

• Bitbucket: Git repository management system for hosting and managing code repositories

• GitLab: Web-based Git repository manager with integrated CI/CD pipelines and collaboration features
