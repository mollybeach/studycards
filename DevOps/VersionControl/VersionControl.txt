Version Control
Q) What is version control in DevOps?
A) Version control in DevOps refers to the practice of tracking changes to code, documents, and other files using version control systems. It enables teams to collaborate, track changes, and manage code repositories effectively. Version control helps teams maintain code quality, track changes, and collaborate on software development projects.
Q) Why is version control important in DevOps?
A) Version control is important in DevOps because it:
• Tracks changes to code, documents, and files to maintain a history of revisions
• Enables collaboration and concurrent development by multiple team members
• Facilitates code reviews, branching, and merging to manage code changes
• Supports automation, continuous integration, and deployment pipelines
• Ensures code quality, consistency, and reliability in software development
Q) What are some common version control systems used in DevOps?
A) Common version control systems used in DevOps include:
• Git: Distributed version control system for tracking changes to code and files
• GitHub: Web-based platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on projects
• Bitbucket: Git repository management system for hosting and managing code repositories
• GitLab: Web-based Git repository manager with integrated CI/CD pipelines and collaboration features
